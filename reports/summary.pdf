📄 Project Summary Report: Predicting Patient No-Shows for Telemedicine Appointments
🧠 Objective:
To predict whether a patient will miss a scheduled telemedicine appointment using historical appointment and patient-related data. This enables clinics to reduce no-show rates, improve scheduling efficiency, and proactively intervene.

📦 Dataset Overview:
Total Records: 71,959

Source: Modified version of the Medical Appointment No-Show dataset (Kaggle)

Key Fields:

Demographics: age, gender, neighbourhood

Clinical: hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, scholarship

Appointment Info: lead_time_days, appointment_mode, reminder_sent, reported_issue

Target: no_show (1 = No-Show, 0 = Showed up)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights:
Most appointments were attended, but ~20% were no-shows.

Reminders reduced no-shows significantly.

Longer lead time between scheduling and appointment increased no-show risk.

Audio appointments had slightly higher no-show tendencies compared to video.

Younger patients and some neighborhoods showed higher no-show patterns.

🤖 Modeling Results:
Two models were trained and compared:

Model	Accuracy	ROC-AUC
Logistic Regression	71.4%	0.589
XGBoost (Selected)	71.1%	0.604 ✅

XGBoost was selected for its better probability calibration and interpretability.

🔍 Top Features from XGBoost
(Based on model.feature_importances_)

Feature	Interpretation
reminder_sent	Most influential: sending reminders clearly reduces no-shows
lead_time_days	Longer wait between booking and appointment = higher risk
appointment_mode_audio	Audio appointments slightly more likely to be missed
reported_issue_flu	Common minor complaints (like flu/cold) correlate with more no-shows
age	Younger age groups were slightly more likely to no-show

🎯 Business Recommendations:
Auto-Reminder System: Prioritize SMS/email/IVR reminders for patients with higher no-show risk.

Appointment Scheduling Policy:

Reduce lead times for first-time or young patients.

Limit audio-only appointments where possible.

Risk-based Overbooking: Slightly overbook high-risk time slots (e.g., long lead-time, Monday mornings).

Dashboard Alerts: Flag likely no-shows to clinic admin for follow-up.

📌 Outcome
This model helps clinics and telemedicine platforms improve appointment adherence, reduce wasted doctor time, and enable proactive outreach — delivering measurable impact to operational efficiency.
